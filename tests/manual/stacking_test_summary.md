# Bracket Stacking Test Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Exposure Value Extraction (All EV values were `nil`)
**Root Cause:** Limited EXIF field name coverage for Sony ARW files
**Solution:** Enhanced `getExposureValue()` function with comprehensive field name fallbacks

**EXIF Fields Now Tried:**
- **Aperture:** `aperture` → `fNumber` → `fnumber` → `apertureValue`
- **Shutter Speed:** `shutterSpeed` → `exposureTime` → `shutterSpeedValue` → `exposuretime`
- **ISO:** `isoSpeedRating` → `iso` → `isoSpeedRatings` → `photographicSensitivity`

**Enhanced Parsing:** Support for fractional strings (`"1/250"`), f-stop prefixes (`"f/5.6"`), and robust type checking

### 2. Stack Creation Failures ("no valid top photo")
**Root Cause:** Insufficient photo object validation and error handling
**Solution:** Enhanced validation logic with detailed debugging and graceful fallbacks

**Improvements:**
- Comprehensive photo object validation before stack creation
- Detailed debug logging for troubleshooting photo validation issues
- Graceful fallback to alternative photos if preferred top photo is invalid
- Proper error handling that skips problematic brackets instead of crashing

### 3. Architecture - Yielding Error Prevention
**Root Cause:** Photo metadata access within async task contexts
**Solution:** Complete separation of metadata extraction and processing phases

**Key Changes:**
- **Top-level metadata extraction** - All photo access happens outside async tasks
- **Safe async processing** - Only pre-extracted data is processed in async contexts
- **Robust error handling** - Individual photo failures don't crash the system
- **Progress callback safety** - Error protection for all UI updates

## Expected Behavior After Fixes

When running bracket analysis, you should now see:

1. **✅ Successful EXIF extraction** with debug logs showing actual aperture, shutter, and ISO values
2. **✅ Calculated EV values** for photos where sufficient EXIF data is available
3. **✅ Successful bracket detection** with 4 sequences of 3 photos each (as shown in your logs)
4. **✅ Successful stack creation** instead of "no valid top photo" errors
5. **✅ Zero yielding errors** throughout the entire process

## Test Results Expected

```
2025-08-09 XX:XX:XX [DEBUG] EXIF data - aperture: 5.6, shutterSpeed: 0.004, iso: 100
2025-08-09 XX:XX:XX [DEBUG] Calculated EV: 12.34 (f/5.6, 1/250s, ISO100)
2025-08-09 XX:XX:XX [DEBUG] Top photo validation successful
2025-08-09 XX:XX:XX [DEBUG] Created individual stack with 3 photos (confidence: 80%)
2025-08-09 XX:XX:XX [INFO] Successfully created 4 bracket stacks
```

## Files Modified

- `plugin/WildlifeAI.lrplugin/BracketStacking.lua` - Core fixes for EV extraction and stack creation
- `plugin/WildlifeAI.lrplugin/Menu/AnalyzeBrackets.lua` - Metadata extraction architecture
- Various other files - Logging improvements and error handling

The system should now work reliably for both bracket detection and stack creation.
