# WildlifeAI Usage

## Detection Workflow

- Select images in Lightroom.
- Run **WildlifeAI: Analyze Selected Photos** for single exposures.
- For bracketed sets choose **WildlifeAI: Analyze Brackets** then review the **Bracket Preview** shown before **WildlifeAI: Stack Brackets**.
- Use **WildlifeAI: Clear Bracket Analysis** to reset bracket data.
- Inspect crops with **WildlifeAI: Review Crops…** and finalize stacks.

## Configuration Options

- Use **WildlifeAI: Configure…** to set runner paths, logging, and performance settings like **Max Workers** and preview delay.
- Toggle logging and debug mode from the menu for additional diagnostics.

## Troubleshooting

- Enable logging and open the log folder for detailed error messages.
- Verify runner paths if analysis fails to start.
- Reanalyze brackets if stacking produces unexpected groups.

## Best Practices for Bracketed Panoramas

- Shoot from a tripod with manual exposure and consistent white balance.
- Leave 30–50% overlap between frames and keep bracket sequences ordered.
- Avoid moving subjects between bracket sets.

## Performance Tips

- Match the worker count to available CPU cores.
- Disable preview or shorten the delay when stacking many brackets.
- Close other applications to free memory and CPU time.
