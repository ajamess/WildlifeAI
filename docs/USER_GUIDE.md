# WildlifeAI User Guide

This guide covers installation and day‑to‑day usage of the WildlifeAI Lightroom
plug‑in.

## Installation

1. Build the plug‑in (see `BUILDING.md`) or download a prebuilt
   `WildlifeAI.lrplugin.zip`.
2. Unzip the archive or leave it zipped. Lightroom can load either form.
3. Open **File > Plug‑in Manager…** in Lightroom Classic.
4. Click **Add** and browse to the `WildlifeAI.lrplugin` directory or zip file.
5. Ensure the plug‑in is enabled.

## Configuration

Choose **Library > Plug‑in Extras > WildlifeAI: Configure…** to set the paths to
the Python runner executables. Logging can also be turned on or off here. The
default paths are:

- Windows: `bin/win/kestrel_runner.exe`
- macOS: `bin/mac/kestrel_runner`

## Running Analysis

1. Select photos in the Library module.
2. Choose **Library > Plug‑in Extras > WildlifeAI: Analyze Selected Photos**.
3. Progress is shown while the runner processes the images. JSON files are
   written alongside the originals when possible or in `Pictures/.kestrel`.
4. After completion new metadata fields are populated. Enable the *WildlifeAI*
   tagset from the Metadata panel to view them.
5. Smart collections named *WildlifeAI: Quality ≥ 90* and *WildlifeAI: Low
   Confidence ≤ 50* are created automatically for quick access.

## Reviewing Crops

Use **WildlifeAI: Review Crops…** to display cropped preview images generated by
the runner. If no crop exists for a file the dialog shows *(no crop)*.

## Keywording and Stacking

Keywords can be applied based on detected species, quality bucket and confidence
level. Photo stacks can be created per scene count via **WildlifeAI: Stack by
Scene Count**.

## Logs and Troubleshooting

- Enable or disable logging from the configuration dialog or via
  **WildlifeAI: Toggle Logging**.
- View the log folder using **WildlifeAI: Open Log Folder**. The main log file is
  `wildlifeai.log`.
- If the plug‑in reports that the runner is missing, verify the paths in the
  configuration dialog or rebuild the plug‑in.
