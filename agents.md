# Agents Guide

Welcome to the `WildlifeAI` agents documentation. This guide provides instructions for agents working within this codebase.

## Responsibilities

- **Read and understand the codebase documentation.**
    - Review all relevant documentation files included in the repository.
    - Pay special attention to architectural overviews, API references, and usage guides.

- **Consult the Lightroom Classic SDK documentation.**
    - The SDK documentation is located in the `docs` folder.
    - Use this resource to understand integration points, supported features, and best practices for working with Lightroom Classic.

## Getting Started

1. **Explore the `/docs` folder**  
     Locate and read the Lightroom Classic SDK documentation.

2. **Review codebase documentation**  
     Check for `README.md`, module-specific docs, and any other files that explain the structure and usage of the code.

3. **Ask questions if needed**  
     If anything is unclear, reach out to the maintainers or refer to official documentation.

## Best Practices

- Always verify information from both the codebase and SDK documentation.
- Document any findings or decisions for future reference.
- Keep documentation up to date as you make changes.
